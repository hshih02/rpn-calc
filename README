All aspects have been correctly implemented to the best of our knowledge.

==============================================
DEPARTURES FROM RECOMMENDED CALLING CONVENTION
==============================================
r1 does not store a return value, only a return address. Return values
are generally stored in the value stack r3 and popped off when needed.
In some cases, a function will preemptively push values in r5/r4 onto the
call stack to pass them into the next function. Pop will be handled in the 
callee function in such cases.

The print module is implemented as a recursive function that prints one digit
at a time.
